%Exploratory code for finding overlapping wave synch in spk data

%exclude waveforms with excessive continuous oscillation: 
% assume this suggests noise

%examples = {};
%templates = {};

%perform matching and subtraction based on location
% of largest peaks to generate candidates


%perform stat analysis to generate examples of extreme synch
